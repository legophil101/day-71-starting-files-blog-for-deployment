        <h2>Hello, I'm Phil 👋</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a multi-passionate creator who lives at the intersection of code, fitness, customer care, and gaming. Whether I’m writing clean code, breaking a sweat at the gym, solving a user’s problem with empathy, or dominating in a game lobby — I go all in.
        </p>

        <h3>💻 Programming</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy building things that make life better — from websites to tools that automate the boring stuff. I’m always exploring new tech, writing clean, maintainable code, and solving real-world problems through software.
        </p>

        <h3>🏋️‍♂️ Fitness</h3>
        <p>
          The gym is my sanctuary. Strength training has taught me resilience, focus, and the power of consistency. I bring that same energy and discipline to every part of my life.
        </p>

        <h3>🎮 Gaming</h3>
        <p>
          Gaming is more than just a hobby — it's how I unwind, compete, and sometimes connect with friends around the world. From tactical shooters to immersive RPGs, I’m all in.
        </p>

        <h3>🤝 Customer Service</h3>
        <p>
          With a background in customer service, I understand the value of clear communication and empathy. I take pride in helping people and finding solutions that actually work.
        </p>
